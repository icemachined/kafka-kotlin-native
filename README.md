Fully Native [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) client for [Kotlin Native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-overview.html).
Uses native [c-interop](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-c-interop.html) with highly performant and reliable [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) C client library.
This library contains no JVM dependencies, no jvm runtime required.
It uses [Kotlin Native memory model](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-concurrency-overview.html) and
[Multithreaded coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-concurrency-and-coroutines.html#multithreaded-coroutines)
for non-blocking interaction with native callbacks and asynchronous workers.


## Contribution

We will be glad if you will test `kafka-kotlin-native` or contribute to this project.
In case you don't have much time for this - at least spend 5 seconds to give us a star to attract other contributors!

**Thanks!** :pray: :partying_face:

## Supported platforms

The code has both **common** and **native** parts. 
It can be built for each platform for which librdkafka has support.
Currently, this is Linux, Windows and Mac OSX.

For more information about platforms and how to install librdkafka see [librdkafka installation](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka#installation)

## Dependency

The library is hosted on the [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.icemachined/kafka-client).

## Features

* Synchronous and asynchronous send
* Leverages kotlin-native coroutines and memory model
* Polling Kafka consumer
* Parallel polling Kafka consumer
* Headers enrichment
* Error handling extension points
* Possibility to leverage [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) features


## How to use

See example of usage in [example project](https://github.com/saveourtool/kafka-client-test)
This example shows how to start/stop producer and consumer and how to configure it.

## Configuration

* [librdkafka configuration](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md) properties,
  which you can pass to producer and consumer constructor.
* Serializer/Deserializer for key and value.
